When you click in green glass, the trade will be confirmed.

Its a trade plugin, you do `/trade <player nick>`, open a menu and you put item, if target player accept, we put a item and open inventory to you, if accept the trade, give items to two players.

/aceitar <player nick> accept a trade.

Because I only was have **two hours** to make this, can have many bugs.
